# Project 7 : Implementing a scoring model

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model, for a bank, to predict if a customer will be able to pay back a loan. <br><br>
The idea is to create a dashboard accessible to bank advisors to help them advise their clients more accurately <br><br>
The project is organized as follows : an API predicting the probabilty that a customer of the bank does not repay his loan and a dashboard that will query the API and display different informations about the client <br><br>
Summary of the project :
- [Source code for the Dasboard](https://github.com/Boudh/P7/tree/main/Dash)
- [Source code of the API](https://github.com/Boudh/P7/tree/main/api_pred)
- [Feature Engineering & Modeling Notebooks](https://github.com/Boudh/P7/tree/main/Notebooks)
